# TriMetric-Serial-Data
Serial Data from a TriMetric 2030

--------------

Our goal is to read, parse, and handle serial data from the Bogart Engineering TriMetric TM-2030 Battery Monitor, and a connected Bogart SC-2030 Charge Controller.

Product info may be found at http://www.bogartengineering.com/

http://www.bogartengineering.com/sites/default/files/docs/TM2025-TM2030%20Technical%20Information%20On%20Serial%20Data%20Output_0.pdf provides partial documentation for retrieving serial data from the previous model, the TM-2025.  It does not contain all the fields the 2030 does, and offers no insight to the data coming from the SC-2030.

The end goal is to provide this data to the "Power" section of a web page that will show near real time status of my solar powered back yard observaotry.
